This program is an enhanced version of PuTTY.
![Main interface](https://github.com/1351a/Putty-plus/blob/main/images/show1.png)
It preserves all core PuTTY functionality while adding a more modern user interface and session saving features (PuTTY’s original UI is honestly quite outdated).
Click the gear icon at the bottom to open Settings, where you can:
•	Change the path of the PuTTY executable used for connections
•	Switch the application language (currently supported: English and Chinese)
This project is developed using Qt 6.8 (C++) and is built with qmake.
